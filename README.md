# Buddy Guard - Social Safety dApp

[[`Buddy-Guard`]] makes digital nomad and solo traveler experiences in daily life safer by integrating a private social graph with ‘trusted’ group clustering that you can personalize. The groups are formed by connecting in person during events or by attending registered conferences or side events. Being part of a group gives you access to connect and join ‘plans’ posted by other group members. Also, the users in the group can request a safety-guard group that can support or check on the user’s safety issues.
